Hey! thanks for visiting my webpage :wave:

I am a [Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=juan.guerrero) of the [CAD group](https://cad.polito.it/) in the Department of Control and Computer Engineering [DAUIN](https://www.dauin.polito.it/) from Politecnico di Torino - [PoliTo](https://www.polito.it/) in Turin, Italy. 

I completed my Ph.D (2024) in Computer and Control Engineering from [PoliTo](https://www.polito.it/), where I was advised by [Prof. Matteo Sonza Reorda](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=matteo.sonzareorda) and [Prof. Ernesto Sanchez](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=012684). During my Ph.D I worked on the reliability enhancement of GPU architectures. Also, I obtained twice the Ph.D quality awards of my cycle. This distinction is given by the doctoral school of [PoliTo](https://www.polito.it/) to the best Ph.D students every year. I obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in electronics engineering from [Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia](https://uptc.edu.co/sitio/portal/) in 2013 and 2017, respectively.

From 2014 to 2020, I was an assistant professor at the [Electronics Engineering School](https://www.uptc.edu.co/sitio/portal/sitios/universidad/vic_aca/facultades/fac_inge/preg/ing_54660_t/03_docth.html) of the [Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia](https://uptc.edu.co/sitio/portal/), where I used to teach digital design, embedded systems, computer architecture, and image processing with FPGAs. 

My research work focuses on the design of dependable hardware for safety-critical applications, comprising a wide spectrum of flavors, including but not limited to:
* Advanced digital design for FPGAs
* Computational arithmetic for AI
* Accelerators for vision applications
* Functional in-field testing of hardware components (e.g., CPUs, and GPUs)
* Dependability and fault tolerance for AI accelerators 
* AI reliability assessment (i.e., error modeling of hardware faults).
